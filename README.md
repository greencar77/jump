Source code generation engine. Inspired by Spring Initializr https://start.spring.io/

Main differences from Spring Initializr:
1) not restricted to Spring Boot framework, for example, to have ability to generate a classic WAR with REST services without Spring;
2) more variance in project content generation (different kinds of class, method and pattern templates).
